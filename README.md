Research on robust bayeisan with perturbed gaussian mixture model


Mainly to replicate the experiment in section 5 of [Jeffrey Miller 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2018.1469995#:~:text=The%20standard%20approach%20to%20Bayesian,outcome%20of%20a%20Bayesian%20procedure.)


Tried to investigate the MCMC efficiency in
